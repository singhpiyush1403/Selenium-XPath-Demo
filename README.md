# Selenium-XPath-Demo
This project demonstrates how to use XPath in Selenium WebDriver with Java. It interacts with the Quikr website to locate and click elements using XPath. The script retrieves and prints text from multiple matching elements. It also displays the page title and current URL before closing the browser.
